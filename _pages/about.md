Hello!👋👋👋

I am a First-year Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Qionghai Dai](https://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/cn/info/1009/1112.htm)(Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering) and [Ass.Prof. Yitong Chen](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn/FacultyDetail.aspx?id=236&infoid=66&flag=66).

My research interest includes Optical neural networks and Deep learning. 

I am working hard to explore the mysteries of Optical neural networks. 😄😄😄
